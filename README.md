# Yet Another Rice
This is my script for installing a GUI on Arch. This was made for my own use, but feel free to fork it and tell me your opinion about it.  
All of the settings are made with **1920x1080** in mind, functionality in other resolutions is not guaranteed.

This rice is made in a way that allows the user to quickly update the colorscheme of the system using pywal.  
Use `setwallpaper` to change the system's wallpaper correctly.  
Use `generatecolorscheme` to change the system's colors.

## Specs

- TWM - BSPWM
- Compositor - Picom
- App Launcher - rofi
- Bar - PolyBar
- Animated Wallpaper - xwinwrap
