# Yet Another Rice
This is my script for installing a GUI on Arch. This was made for my own use but feel free to fork it.  
All of the settings are made with **1920x1080** in mind, functionality in other resolutions is not guaranteed.

## Specs

- TWM - BSPWM
- Compositor - Picom
- App launcher - rofi
- Bar - PolyBar

# Installing

    chmod +x ./install-on-arch.sh
    sh install-on-arch.sh
    await until the tomfoolery ends
